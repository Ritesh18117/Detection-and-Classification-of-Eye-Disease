1. Project Overview

This repository demonstrates methods for detecting and classifying various eye diseases from medical imaging data. It contains Jupyter notebook implementations, exploratory analysis, model training, and classification pipelines.

2. Features

- Preprocessing and image augmentation techniques
- CNN-based image classification pipeline
- Multi-class classification (e.g., detecting conditions like cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy)
- Visualization of model performance (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix)
- Modular and reproducible code structure

3. Dataset

You should provide a brief description of the dataset. Here’s a template you can adapt:
- Source: Describe the origin (e.g., publicly available dataset like EyePACS, collected clinic data, etc.)
- Contents: Number of images, classes, image modalities, file structure
- Structure:
    └── dataset/
        ├── class_1/
        │   ├── img1.jpg
        │   └── ...
        ├── class_2/
        │   └── ...
        └── ...

4. Getting Started
Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have the following installed:
    - Python 3.8 or higher
    - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
    - Key libraries:
        - pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
     
(Adjust based on whether you’re using PyTorch or OpenCV, etc.)

5. Model Architecture

Outline the core structure. For instance:
- Convolutional layers (filters, kernel size, activation)
- Pooling layers
- Dense layers and dropout
- Final softmax layer for classification


7. Results

Highlight model performance:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots
- Confusion matrix or classification report
- Final accuracy and loss values
